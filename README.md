## Summary
This repository contains code from various courses and projects completed during my Bachelor of Aerospace Engineering degree at TU Delft between 2013 and 2016. 

Some of the projects are collaborative and contain work by other students, which is included to avoid breaking the code. If I am not the author of a specific file or snippet, this has been indicated by comments in the code. However since I am unable to grant license for such work, please follow carefully the licensing information in each specific folder. MIT license placed in the folder applies to all files in this folder or subfolders (but not the project or repository). MIT license may also be added to a specific file if I am allowed to grant it. In all other cases, no license is granted.

## Highlights
Some interesting projects in this repo:

- [SciComputing with Pyton/CMB](SciComputing%20with%20Python/CMB) is a 2D simulation and visualization of the early universe, based on the 9th year release of WMAP data
- [Test-Analysis-Simulation]([Test-Analysis-Simulation/) contains tools for visualizing sound sources (beamforming, acoustic camera) using data from the TU Delft Acoustic array
- [Simulation-Verification-Validation](Simulation-Verification-Validation/) is a package which calculates and visualizes stress distribution of an aft airplane fuselage subject to vertical stabilizer load
- [Systems Design](Systems%20Design/stiffness_v4.py) is an implementation of genetic algortihm optimization for sizing the wing box of a wing.
