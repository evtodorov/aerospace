This repository contains code from various courses and projects completed during my Bachelor of Aerospace Engineering degree at TU Delft between 2013 and 2016. 

Some of the projects are collaborative and contain work by other students, which is included to avoid breaking the code. If I am not the author of a specific file or snippet, this has been indicated by comments in the code. However since I am unable to grant license for such work, please follow carefullt the licensing infrmation in each specific folder. MIT license placed in the folder applies to all files in this folder or subfolders (but not the project or repository). MIT license may also be added to a specific file if I am allowed to grant it. In all other cases, no license is granted.
